In this tutorial, together with Prof. Ingmar Weber, we introduced satellite imagery as a fresh data source for social scientists. We strived to bridge the gap between Earth Observation and social media data analysis, fostering interdisciplinary cooperation. We also tackled the need for responsible data use standards. Attendees explored the use of satellite data and engaged in interactive discussions. We also provided hands-on training in Google Earth Engine, demonstrating the long-lasting effects of racially biased housing policies, visible from space.
