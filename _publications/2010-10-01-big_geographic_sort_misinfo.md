collection: publications
permalink: /publication/paper-number-5
excerpt: 'TL;DR Our study challenges the traditional understanding of online news circulation, demonstrating that it is not just individual characteristics and social media algorithms at play, but also the influence of localized *offline* self-segregation (the Big Sort) in the US. The study underscores that the diffusion of news, especially misinformation, is significantly influenced by state-level personality, cultural factors, and education levels, highlighting the geographical nature of online interactions.
