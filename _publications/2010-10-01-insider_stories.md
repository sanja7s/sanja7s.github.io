excerpt: 'TL;DR While many modern corporations proclaim their commitment to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), allegations of "greenwashing" are not uncommon. This study employs Glassdoor reviews to quantify an underexplored facet of CSR -- internal sustainability. This broad term encapsulates various policies targeted towards internal stakeholders, such as advocating for a balanced work-life ecosystem, prioritizing gender equality and diversity, and fostering a harassment-free work environment.'
