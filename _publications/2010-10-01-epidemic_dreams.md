title: "Epidemic dreams: dreaming about health during the COVID-19 pandemic"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/paper-number-6
excerpt: 'TL;DR We show that COVID dreams feature both common and specific symptom mentions, when compared to waking life COVID experiences. E.g., expressions in waking life described realistic symptoms (e.g. nasal pain, SARS, H1N1); while those in dreaming life reflected either conditions unrelated to the virus (e.g. maggots, deformities, snake bites), or conditions of surreal nature (e.g. teeth falling out, body crumbling into sand).'
